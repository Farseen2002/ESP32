Arduino IDE setup (one-time)
1.	Install Arduino IDE (or use VS Code PlatformIO).
2.	Add ESP32 board support: Tools → Manage Libraries → install esp32 by Espressif Systems.
•	The one you need is:
Blynk by Volodymyr Shymanskyy (current version 1.3.2)
👉 Click Install on that.
⚠️ Do NOT install BlynkESP32_BT_WF or BlynkEthernet_Manager — those are for special cases. Stick with the official Blynk library.
3.	Library Manager → install Blynk library.
4.	In Tools, select the correct ESP32 board and the COM port.
For DHT11 sensor
Install this library:
•	“DHT sensor library for ESPx by beegee_tokyo”

Note:
If the ESP32 not compiling/ not uploading, do the following step also:
•	File → Preferences → Additional boards manager URLs
Paste
"https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json"
and click OK.
 
Create a Blynk project & get the Auth token
1.	Install the Blynk app on your phone (Blynk IoT / Blynk app depending on which you use).
2.	Create a New Device / New Project → choose ESP32 Dev Board (or similar).
3.	Add a Button widget to the project.
o	Set the Button’s Output to V0 (Virtual Pin V0).
o	Set widget to Switch (not push).
4.	Copy the Auth Token / Device Token— you’ll paste it in the code.
